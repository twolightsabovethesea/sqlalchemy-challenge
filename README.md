# sqlalchemy-challenge

The project was done for the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp using  SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Python, and Flask. The project has several parts done in succession.

First, SQLAlchemy was used in a Jupyter Notebook to explore Hawaii Climate data from a sqlite file. This data was manipulated and visualized to answer specific questions about temperatures and precipitation.

Next, a Flask server was created using a .py file. Within the Flask api, several routes were created to serve various climate data drawn from the same sqlite file used above.

Finally, the bonus section involved two additional Jupyter Lab notebooks. In the first notebook, dataframes were made using reading CSV data for weather in Hawaii; this data was then visualized to show averages. In the second notebook, SQLAlchemy was again used to bring in and manipulate data, which was visualized in a bar plot. (Note: due to time constraints, the second bonus notebook is currently unfinished.)
